# Ideas

* command: "john setup" could check the local dir for a script and run it for the user (or something like that). Example: Rails files need to run bundle update, might use vagrant or docker so run those setup commands.
* command: "john share <file>" copy file and make a private gist or snippet
* command: "john pom" generates a pom for you. end sound? see https://github.com/edelprino/pom for example
   * Set slack/hipchat status as away
* command: "john track start <message>" adds and starts harvest timing
* command: "john track stop" stops last tracking started through john?
* command: "john status projectionhub.com" using AWS it could print out server statuses
    * Servers 
    * public ips
    * uptime
    * loads at current time
    * etc
* command: "john report" - pulls fun stats from a project and builds a report. Examples: commit count, commit streak, sprint burndown, invoice, PRs, Branches, deploys
